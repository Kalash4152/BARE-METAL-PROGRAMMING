🔧 Bare-Metal AVR Embedded Projects 👨‍💻⚡
This repository is a curated collection of bare-metal embedded C projects designed for AVR microcontrollers 🧠🔌. All programs are written without the use of any high-level libraries or operating systems — just pure register-level programming 💻📘.

Each project dives deep into the core of embedded systems development, covering essential topics like:

🟢 GPIO control

⏱️ Timer configuration

🔁 Interrupt handling

📡 Peripheral interfacing (like UART, ADC, etc.)

These examples are perfect for students, hobbyists, and professionals who want to understand how microcontrollers work under the hood 🛠️🚀. Whether you're building a solid foundation in embedded systems or looking to refresh your low-level C skills, this repo has something for you! 💡📂
